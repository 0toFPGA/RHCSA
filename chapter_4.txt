Chapter 4 notes:
KEY TOPIC:
    less → opens a text file pager
    cat → dumps contents of the text file onto screen
    head → shows the top of the file
    tail → shows the bottom of the file
    cut → used to filter specific columns or characters from a text file
    sort → sorts contents
    wc → counts # of lines, words, and characters long.

for short files use cat, it just dumps the content onto your screen.
    Example: cat /etc/passwd
        cat dumps file in order so you can reverse cat to tac to get the top of the file at the bottom on your screen.
