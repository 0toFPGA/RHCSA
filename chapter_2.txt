#notes on chapter2

Shell skills:
Alias, internal commands and external commands

Alias=command that a user can define as needed, some are defined by default.

internal commnands= a commnand that is apart of the shell itself and as shuch does not need to be loaded from the disk seperatly.**


External commands= a commnand that exsists as an executable file on the disk of the computer**
    
    ** READING_into_this more**
        The reading that came of this shows that the files that are baked into the shell (cd, fg, source etc...) are faster. That is due to the fact that there is no need for the shell to go out and search the given path for them in the PATH variable. Also there is no process that is spawned for executing it.

I/O Redirection
STDIN -> <    0
STDOUT -> >   1
STDERR -> 2>  2

> (is the same as 1>)= Redirects STDOUT. If redirection is to a file the current contents of that file are OVERWRITTEN.

>> (same as 1>>)= Redirects STDOUT in append mode. If output is written to a file, the output is appended to that file.

2> = Redirects STDERR

2>&1 = Redirects STDERR to the same destination as STDOUT. Notice that this has to be used in combination with normal combination with normal output redirection.

< = Redirects STDIN

editing with VIM

a nice to know is how to use vim*

2 modes command mode and input mode-
command mode= you can just enter a command and you cannot edit the contents of the file.
input mode= where you can edit/change the contents of the file.

appears that there is a lot of commands when working with vim...
    **TIP- try to work with as few commands as you can to start when working with vim, start small and work your way up!
        Might try vimtutor- it is a tutorial that walks you through how to use vim easliy?

Esc= switchs from input mode to command mode. press it before typing any command
i, a= switches to input mode at (i) or after(a) current cursor position.
o= opens a new line below your position and goes into input mode.
:wq= Writes and quits the file
:q!= Quits the file without applying any changes. the ! forces the command to do its work, add the ! only if you really know what you are doing.
:w filename= Writes the current filename with a new filename
dd= deletes the current line and places the contents of the deleted line into memory
yy= copies the current line
p= pastes the contents that have been cut or copied into memory
v= enters visual mode, which allows you to select a block of text using the arrow keys. Use d to cut the selection or y to copy it.
u= undoes the last command. can use as much as needed.
Ctrl+ r= Redoes the last undo. (can only be repeated once)
gg= Goes to the first line in the document
G= goes to the last line in the document.
/text= searches for text from the current position forward
?text= searches for text from the current position backwards
^= goes to the first postition in the current line
$= goes to the last position in the current line
!ls= adds the output of ls (or any other command) in the current file
:%s/old/new/g= replacs all occurances of old with new *and that is global because of the g at the end*


Shell ENV-

Variables are fixed names that can be assigned dynamic values.
    the example- $LANG, which is set on my machine to en_US.UTF-8
        I am curious why it is that- 
        NOT RELEVENT
        [
        en= english (makes sense)
        US= US territory
        UTF.8= Unicode Transformation Format- 8-bit: This is the character encoding that determines how characters are stored as binary data.
            it is backwards compatible with with ASCII, using  a single byte for ASCII characters and one to four bytes for other characters, which allows it to handle a vast ranfe of languages, symbols and emojis.
            1-byte: Characters from U + 0000 to U + 007F use one byte, structured as 0xxxxxxx
            2-byte: Characters from U + 0080 to U + 07FF use 2 bytes, structured as 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3-byte: Characters from U + 0800 to U + FFFF use 3 bytes, structured as 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4-byte: Characters from U + 10000 to U +1FFFFF use 4 bytes, structured as 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            **this was a little side quest that I thought was cool, I hope that it comes up at a later date!
            ]

ENV config files:
/etc/profile= a generic file that is processed by all users upon login
/etc/bashrc= this file is processed when subshells are started.
.bash_profile= user specific login shell variables can be defined
.bashrc= user specific file where subsystem variables can be defined.
    They make a note between these files, there is a login shell and a subshell.
    The login shell- is the first shell that is opened for a user after the user logged in
        here the user can run scripts which will start a subshellof that login shell.

HELP ***SUPER USEFUL!!***
There are way too many commands in linux and it is severly overwhelming to try and even scratch the surface trying to memorize them all.
    use the man command - it is a phenomenal resource for getting help about command syntax and usage!
    you can also use command --help
        simple as " <command> --help"
            Nearly all commands provide a short overview of help when you use the option --help, it is Nearly not all because some find it erroneous...
            Thankfully they will display an ERROR message and then will display the valid options with the command.

*** MAKE YOUR MANDB IS UP TO DATE!! run command sudo mandb to check
Searching the mandb database by using apropos or man -k followed by the keyword that you want to search for.
    apropos is the same as man -k

Man pages are catagorized into different sections. The most relevent sections for system admins are as follows:
1: Executable programs or shell commands    ---
5: File formats and conventions                |-- KEY TOPICS
8: System administration commands           ---  

You can lower the results that are shown by using the grep command to show the sections that are only relevent to what you need.
    if you are looking for a a config file that has something to do with passwords you would use something like the following:
        man -k password | grep 5
    if you are looking the command that an admin would use to create partitions you would use the following:
        man -k partitions | grep 8

mentioned very late in the book but /usr/share/doc is a great source to find information like the following:
    rsyslog,bind, Kerberos, and OpenSSL
