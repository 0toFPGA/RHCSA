Shell skills:
Alias, internal commands and external commands

Alias=command that a user can define as needed, some are defined by default.

internal commnands= a commnand that is apart of the shell itself and as shuch does not need to be loaded from the disk seperatly.**


External commands= a commnand that exsists as an executable file on the disk of the computer**
    
    ** READING_into_this more**
        The reading that came of this shows that the files that are baked into the shell (cd, fg, source etc...) are faster. That is due to the fact that there is no need for the shell to go out and search the given path for them in the PATH variable. Also there is no process that is spawned for executing it.

I/O Redirection
STDIN -> <    0
STDOUT -> >   1
STDERR -> 2>  2

> (is the same as 1>)= Redirects STDOUT. If redirection is to a file the current contents of that file are OVERWRITTEN.

>> (same as 1>>)= Redirects STDOUT in append mode. If output is written to a file, the output is appended to that file.

2> = Redirects STDERR

2>&1 = Redirects STDERR to the same destination as STDOUT. Notice that this has to be used in combination with normal combination with normal output redirection.

< = Redirects STDIN
